# Issue #43 Implementation Status

## ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION - SERVICE CREATED BUT NOT INTEGRATED

### What Was Done ✅
- Created `DeckBuilderService` with all specified functionality
- Created `DeckValidator` for format rule validation  
- Created `DeckStatistics` for deck analysis
- Created `CardCollection` domain model
- Created comprehensive test suite (35 tests, all passing)
- Fixed import paths for clean architecture compliance

### What Was NOT Done ❌
- **No UI Integration** - The service is not used anywhere in the application
- `mtg_deck_builder.py` still contains all the original business logic
- No refactoring of existing UI components to use the new services
- The old code remains unchanged and active

### Current Status
The implementation created the service layer as specified but **did not complete the refactoring**. The new services exist in isolation and are not connected to the actual application. 

To fully complete issue #43, the following still needs to be done:
1. Refactor `mtg_deck_builder.py` to use `DeckBuilderService`
2. Update UI components to call service methods instead of embedded logic
3. Remove duplicated business logic from UI classes
4. Ensure backward compatibility during the transition

### Conclusion
**Issue #43 is NOT fully resolved** - only the service creation part is complete, but the actual refactoring to use these services has not been implemented.
